# Routine-maker
Small program, designed to create a random exercise routine selecting youtube videos from an excel

An excel file is manually created/updated with videos I find online and like. 
I punctuate them according to how I feel while making them.

To create the routine, you set a difficulty level (max points your routine must have) and the program selects routines until that treshold is met.
